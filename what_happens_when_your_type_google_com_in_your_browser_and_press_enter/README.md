What happens when you type https://www.google.com and press Enter

This project is a detailed explanation of what really happens behind the scenes when you type a URL in your browser and hit Enter. Itâ€™s a classic interview question that tests your understanding of the internet, web infrastructure, and full-stack systems.

The journey from your keyboard to your screen involves many invisible but critical steps, including:

Resolving the domain name with DNS

Establishing a TCP/IP connection

Passing through firewalls and security layers

Creating a secure HTTPS session with SSL/TLS

Reaching a load balancer that routes your request

Forwarding the request to a web server

Processing dynamic content on an application server

Accessing and retrieving data from a database

And finally, rendering the result in your browser

All of this happens in a fraction of a second â€” but each part is essential.
